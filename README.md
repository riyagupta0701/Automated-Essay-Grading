# Automated-Essay-Grading

A Natural Language Processing project which is developed using a hybrid model approach of a LSTM and a BERT model. The LSTM model calculates the relevance score of the essay while the BERT model determines the grammar percentage. The linear model combines the two scores, and outputs a final score for the essay.
